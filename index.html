            Hello! My name is Meixu Chen, and welcome to my personal website. I am currently a junior student at NEU. My major is Data science and Business.
            In my personal life, I am passionate about tennis, technology, and travel. 
            This website is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences, and projects related to my interests. Ever since I was young, 
            I have been fascinated by the sport of tennis. Watching legendary players like Roger Federer and Serena Williams inspired me 
            to pick up a racket and improve my game. Playing tennis and enjoying the game become a part of my life.
             Now, let's me explain why I love tennis.

            Tennis is more than just a sport to me; it is a way to challenge myself, stay active, and develop discipline. Whether it is 
            practicing my serves, working on footwork, or engaging in a friendly match, tennis has always been an essential part of my life. 
            I believe that the mental toughness and strategic thinking required in tennis also apply to many aspects of life. On this website, 
            I will share my experiences, favorite matches, and training routines. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions!
